        <p>     Hello, I’m Paige Johnson! I’m a family-oriented individual with a passion for teamwork, 
                problem-solving, and personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>     When I’m not diving into the world of cybersecurity, you’ll often find me on the rugby field. 
                Playing rugby has taught me the value of collaboration, resilience, and strategy—skills that 
                I carry into every aspect of my life.
        </p>
        <p>     Family is at the heart of everything I do, and they inspire me to work hard and strive for success. 
                Whether I’m spending quality time with loved ones or tackling challenges on the field or in the classroom, 
                I aim to bring dedication and enthusiasm to everything I do.
        </p>
        <p>     
                Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting with you and sharing my journey!
        </p>
