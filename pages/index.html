    <p> As a student at the University of Cincinnati, I’m pursuing 
        a degree in Cybersecurity. As I'm currently exploring the exciting
         world of web development. <p>Through my coursework, I’ve been learning 
         how to create responsive, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.<br>

        Web development allows me to combine creativity and problem-solving, and I enjoy transforming 
        ideas into functional, visually appealing digital experiences. <p>This class has challenged me to 
        think critically about design, accessibility, and user engagement while building a strong technical 
        foundation.<br>
        
        <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy collaborating with peers, experimenting with new tools and techniques, 
        and exploring how technology shapes our everyday lives. <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio—feel free 
        to check out my projects 
    </p>
